1. Navbar (Minimal Top-Level Navigation)
    - Positioned at the top, stays visible as the user scrolls.
    - Links: Home, About, Projects, Skills & Tools, Resume, Contact
    - Keyboard-inspired icons next to each link (optiional) - e.g., an Enter key icon near "Contact"
2. Hero Section (Landing Section)
    - Bright and Popping Color Background:
        - Use a vibrant gradient (e.g., Green-Blue + Coral)
        - Centered Text: A Short tagline (e.g., "Crafting Digital Solutions with Purpose")
        - Call-to-Action Button:
            - Subtle animation (like pulse or hover effect)
3. Projects Section (Bento Box Grid)
    - Asymmetric Design:
        - Cards of varying sizes and alignments (some aligned halfway).
        - Hover effects: Cards slide or tilt subtly on hover.
4. Skills & Tools Section
    - Icons or List Style: Grouped under 'Frontend', 'Backend', 'Tools', etc.
5. Resume Download Section
    - Download Button with animation
6. Contact Section
    - Simple Form with Social Links
7. Footer (Easter Egg Animation)
    - Tennis Ball Easter Egg:
        - A hover animation where the tennis ball bouncesi n the Footer

Features to Add Later:
    - Smooth Scrolling: Ensure links in the navbar scroll smoothly to sections.
    - Dark/Light Mode Toggle (Optional): Let users toggle between light and dark mode for customization
    - Subtle Animations on Scroll: Using Tailwind + Intersection Observer to animate cards.

Keyboard-Inspired Animation Ideas
1. Navbar Links with Keypress Hover effect
    - Animation: When you hover over a link in the navbar, it briefly "presses down" like a physical key.
    - Implementation Idea: The link shrinks slightly (scale-95) and bounces back to normal size on hover-out
2. Interactive Call-to-Action Button (With Key Tap Feel)
    - Animation: The button behaves like a key when clicked, with a subtle 'click down' effect, simulation a keypress.
    - Implementation Idea: On click, the button breifly shrinks and changes background color, then reverts.
3. Project Card Hover with 'Typing Cursor' Animation
    - Animation: On hover, a blinking cursor effect appears briefly within the project card title, giving it a subtle 'typing' feel.
    - Implementation Idea: Add a blinkign cursor element that shwos only on hover.
4. Footer Easter Egg with Keyboard Typing Sound
    - Animation: When a user hovers over the tennis ball in the footer, it simulates a soft keyboard typing sound or clicks on each hover.
    - Implementation Idea: On hover, play a sound effect, mimicking the sound of a mechanical keypress. (Use Javascript to trigger audio)
5. Mini "Keys" on Scroll Animation
    - Animation: Small key elements (like an ESC or CTRL key) slide in from the side as the user scrolls down to specific sections, adding palyful interaction without being intrusive.
    - Implementation Idea: Use the Intersection Observer API to trgiger these mini keys when the user reaches certain points in the layout.
6. Button Ripple Effect (Like Typing Keys Pressed)
    - Animation: A ripple effect radiates from the point of click on buttons, simulating the feel of pressing keys on a keyboard.
    - Implementation Idea: Use CSS to create a ripple effect that expands outward from the clicked position.

Minimalist Aniamted Background Ideas
1. Slow Gradient Shift (Ambient Effect)
    - How It Works: A slow color transition between two or more subtle colors over time (like green-blue shifting towards a soft coral).
    - Why It Works: Adds depbt and life to the background without overwhelming the user.
2. Subtle Noise Effect (Moving Particles)
    - How It Works: Small, low-opacity dots or particles move very slowly in the background, almost like static.
    - Why It Works: Adds texture and interest while remaining subtle. Particles shouldn't draw attention - the motion should be very slow.
3. Horizontal or Diagonal Line Animation (Slow Movement)
    - How It Works: Very subtle lines moving horizontally or diagonally across the screen.
    - Why It Works: Provides a sense of movement while still being minimalist.
4. Minimal Dot Grid Animation
    - How It Works: A grid of small dots gently shifts or scales in the background.
    - Why It Works: Adds some geometric flair while keeping things structured and clean.
5. Soft Wave Animation (Minimal Fluid Motion)
    - How It Works: Animated wavy lines move across the background to convey fluidity and calmness.
    - Why It Works: Provides visual interest without feeling over-the-top.

Tips for Using Animated Backgrounds in Minimalist Design:
    1. Keep ANimations Slow: Avoid fast or jarring movements. Minimalist animations should feel ambient and subtle.
    2. Use Low-Opacity Elements: Ensure that animations don't overpower the content.
    3. Limit Animation to Specific Sections: Apply animations only to the hero section or select areas to create focus.
    4. Disable Animations on Mobile: Ensure animations don't impact performance on mobile devices.

Recommended Option for You:
Given your preference for a standout hero section, I suggest going with the slow gradient shift of minimal fot grid animation. These will make the hero section pop while fitting the minimalist aesthetic of your portfolio.
